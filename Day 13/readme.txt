today i took it easy and just watched some debugging tips and debugged some old codes.
1. describe the problem
2. try to reproduce 
3. look at the code and try to execute it in your mind
4. use print often to see if you are getting the expected value.
5. we have a debugger tool in the IDE use it to see how you code executes line by line or go to functions that are imported to the programe by using the step into feature.
