learned about dictionaries by creating two programes 
1. that convers the marks of student in a dictionary to grade
2. created a silent bidding programe that takes user input and computes the highest bidder.

dictionary looks like

travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"],
    "Germany": ["Stuttgart", "Berlin"],
}

we need to mention key to access the dictionary
we can access array also in a dictionary by mentioning the index next like travel_log["France][1] will give out put Lille
