created a game of higher and lower
the major chalenge was defining the logoc on my own knowing how th game works 
if the user A > user b and the choice that i made is correct logic had me thinking about how to implement it.
but at last it was just an if statement

tried to make everything a function so that i get comfortable defining it and also get an idea of when and how to define global and local variable.
